<h1>Palindrome Checker</h1>

<h2>JavaScript Project 1</h2>

<p>A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, for example, radar, toot, and madam. 
We would like to construct an algorithm to input a string of characters and check whether it is a palindrome. The solution to this problem will use a deque to store the characters of the string.</p> 

<p>The purpose of this program is to return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false. A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. The program needs to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces, symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.</p>
