<h1>Palindrome Checker</h1>

<h2>JavaScript Project 1</h2>

<p>A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, for example, radar, toot, and madam. 
We would like to construct an algorithm to input a string of characters and check whether it is a palindrome. The solution to this problem will use a deque to store the characters of the string.</p>
