# Palindrome_Checker

JavaScript Project 1

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, for example, radar, toot, and madam. 
We would like to construct an algorithm to input a string of characters and check whether it is a palindrome. The solution to this problem will use a deque to store the characters of the string.
